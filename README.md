### Message from me

Hi there!

I have been building this fun little project and I have spent about 7 hours on the assignment.
Most of my time was me just having a bunch of fun and playing with different ways of wishful coding,
some making sure my calculations were right and just finding out how to calculate a Pearson Correlation Coeffecient.

Besides that I did my best to showcase my Laravel skills.

In total I have spent about 7 hours on the assignment. One hour was me literally binging videos, trying
to really understand the statistics part.

Hope I have been able to trigger some emotions. Let me know what you think.
